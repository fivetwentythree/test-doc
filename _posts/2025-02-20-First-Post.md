## This is my first post!


## this prompt is more usable for coding scenarios 

This is the original reference and this prompt snippet is inspired by this : [My LLM codegen workflow atm](https://harper.blog/2025/02/16/my-llm-codegen-workflow-atm/)
following is a prompt I found which is directed more towards coding can you analyze this and come up with a prompt which is more usable in the many scenarios, for example if I need to use in a scenario of a novel drug discovery I would be able to change the word relating to pharmacology and use the same prompt, the basic structure has to be same but indicate where I should have to make changes.

Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. Let’s do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

Here’s the idea: <idea>

## this is the one Claude came up with 

```md
I need your expertise to develop a comprehensive plan for my [DOMAIN] project. Please use an iterative questioning approach—one question at a time—to help me thoroughly explore every aspect of this concept.

Each question should build upon my previous answers, gradually creating a detailed roadmap that covers all essential components. Our goal is to produce a complete [DELIVERABLE TYPE] that I can confidently [ACTION] to [STAKEHOLDERS].

Let's approach this methodically to ensure we address all crucial details. Remember to ask just one focused question at a time so we can build depth.

Here's my concept: [CONCEPT DESCRIPTION]
